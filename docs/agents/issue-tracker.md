# Issue tracker: GitHub

Issues and PRDs for this repo live as GitHub issues. Use the `gh` CLI for all
operations.

## Conventions

- **Create an issue**: `gh issue create --title "..." --body "..."`. Use a
  heredoc for multi-line bodies.
- **Read an issue**: `gh issue view <number> --comments`, filtering comments
  with `jq` and also fetching labels.
- **List issues**:
  `gh issue list --state open --json number,title,body,labels,comments`
  with appropriate `--label` and `--state` filters.
- **Comment on an issue**: `gh issue comment <number> --body "..."`
- **Apply or remove labels**:
  `gh issue edit <number> --add-label "..."` or `--remove-label "..."`
- **Close**: `gh issue close <number> --comment "..."`

Infer the repository from `git remote -v`; `gh` does this automatically inside
the clone.

## Pull requests as a triage surface

**PRs as a request surface: no.**

Set this to `yes` if external pull requests should pass through the same triage
states as issues.

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"

Create a GitHub issue.

## When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket"

Run `gh issue view <number> --comments`.

## Wayfinding operations

Used by `/wayfinder`. The map is one issue with child issues as tickets.

- **Map**: an issue labelled `wayfinder:map`, holding Notes,
  Decisions-so-far, and Fog.
- **Child ticket**: a GitHub sub-issue labelled `wayfinder:<type>`, where type
  is `research`, `prototype`, `grilling`, or `task`.
- **Blocking**: use GitHub native issue dependencies. If unavailable, add a
  `Blocked by: #<n>` line to the child issue.
- **Frontier query**: choose the first open, unassigned child without an open
  blocker.
- **Claim**: `gh issue edit <n> --add-assignee @me`
- **Resolve**: comment with the answer, close the child, and add its context
  pointer to the map's Decisions-so-far.
